# MUSI 6202 Assignments

## Instructions for Students
- You can clone the repo for easy update of your local copy. Be careful with git functions when pulling from upstream or you could lose your work. Make backups elsewhere if you are not familiar with git. 
  - **IF YOU FORK THIS REPO, KEEP YOUR PERSONAL REPO PRIVATE.** (See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10065526/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private)
- Alternatively, you can simply download the zip file of the repo as and when you need.
- **DO NOT WORK ON THE ASSIGNMENT BEFORE IT IS UNLOCKED ON CANVAS**, even if it already appears here. Assignment files uploaded here before announcement are subject to changes without notice. 
- Under each assignment folder, there is a folder named `student`. Change this to your GT username (e.g. `gburdell3`). **KEEP ALL YOUR CODE WITHIN THIS FOLDER**. This is the only folder you should include in your submission zip file.
